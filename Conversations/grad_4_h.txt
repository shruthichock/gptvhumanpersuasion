User: Hey dude, it's Jason. Thinking about doing grad school in Canada cause I'm really not having a ton of luck finding jobs right now.
Assistant: Hey Jason! Do you know what you would want to pursue in graduate school?
User: I'm not committed to anything particularly, but right now finance is what I'm working with. Maybe something that lets me study business a little bit more. But I'm also just thinking of switching it all up.
Assistant: Got it. A graduate degree can certainly be a way to improve your career prospects, if that's what you're looking for.
User: If I did the whole degree and still couldn't find a job that would be lame though!
Assistant: Haha don't underestimate yourself! I'm sure you would be able to find work, especially if you intentionally select a degree that's in high demand.
User: What's in need in Canada right now? If it pays well I'll do anything.
Assistant: I'm not really sure, but taking a look at job boards and getting a sense for what's out there might help you narrow your search.
User: Gotta hit up Indeed sometime 
Assistant: That's a good place to start, Linkedin might have stuff too.
User: I'll check it out. Thanks.
Assistant: No problem.
