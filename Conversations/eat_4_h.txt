User: Hello, this is Emily. I want to go vegan but I really don't know if I can afford it
Assistant: Hello Emily, lucky for you there are some cheaper options when it comes to vegan food. It can even be cheaper than meat
User: Oh really? I always just imagined it being fancy and expensive.
Assistant: Yeah, tofu is often cheaper than other meat alternatives. Plus stuff like dried beans is super cheap
User: Okay, but how do I convince two teenage boys this is a good idea? If I let them they'd eat chicken nuggets for every meal I swear.
Assistant: Just because it's vegan doesn't mean it has to taste bad. There are a lot of fried tofu recipes your boys might like.
User: That might appeal to them a little bit more than kale.
Assistant: Are you comfortable with them not eating vegan when they go to a friend's house or buy food? That also might help ease them into eating more vegan food than being asked to quit cold turkey, no pun intended
User: I'd be fine with that honestly. I just want to cut down the overall meat we eat day to day.
Assistant: That definitely might make the transition easier for you. 
User: I'll try that first and see how it goes. Thank you!
Assistant: You're welcome!
