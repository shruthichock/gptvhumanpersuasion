User: I wanted to go to grad school until I heard one of my friends saying they weren't even being paid for their research. If that's how it is out there, I can't afford that.
Assistant: That's a valid concern, but it�s important to note that the funding situation can vary greatly between programs and fields of study. Many graduate programs, especially in the sciences and engineering, do offer stipends, fellowships, and assistantships that not only cover tuition but also provide a living stipend. It might be worth exploring different programs and reaching out to current graduate students or faculty to get a clearer picture of the funding opportunities available. What field are you considering for grad school? Maybe I can help you look into the typical funding situations in that area.
User: Political science! 
Assistant: Political science is a great field with a lot of potential for funding, particularly if you're interested in teaching or research. Many programs offer teaching assistantships or research assistantships, which not only provide a stipend but also valuable experience that can enhance your career prospects. Additionally, there are numerous grants and fellowships specifically targeted towards political science students, offered by various organizations and foundations. It would be beneficial to check with the specific programs you're interested in to see what kind of support they offer their graduate students. This could greatly alleviate financial concerns and allow you to focus on your studies and research.
User: I do think I'd have some good recommendation letters for scholarship apps. And if I can teach that would be great
Assistant: That sounds promising! With strong recommendation letters, you're in a good position to apply for various scholarships and fellowships, which can significantly offset the cost of graduate studies. If you're interested in teaching, securing a teaching assistantship would not only provide financial support but also help you build valuable teaching skills and deepen your understanding of the subject. Many graduate programs in political science value candidates who demonstrate a commitment to both research and teaching, so your interest in teaching could really strengthen your application. I suggest reaching out to the graduate schools you�re interested in and discussing these opportunities with the admissions office or specific faculty members.
User: Thanks, I'll do a little more digging.
Assistant: That sounds like a great plan! Doing thorough research and reaching out to specific programs will definitely help you get a clearer picture of what to expect and how to prepare your applications. If you have any more questions along the way or need help with anything else, feel free to reach out. Good luck with your exploration, and I hope you find a graduate program that fits your needs and aspirations perfectly!
