User: Hi hi! I'm thinking of going back to school for my master's, but I'm not sure I can manange it while also taking care of my daughter.
Assistant: Hello! How old is your daughter right now?
User: She's just 3 years old, so she's definitely a handful. I do have a pretty supportive partner, but I don't want to put too much of a burden on him.
Assistant: Could you arrange for more childcare than you currently do?
User: My mom also lives in the area so I could ask her for a little bit more help.
Assistant: That might not be a bad idea. Another option might be to find a program that allows you to do your course work online.
User: That could be a better fit - then I would just have the issue of getting distracted by her lmao
Assistant: Hahaha. By the way, what do you want to go to grad school for?
User: Urban planning! I'm so interested in the way that cities operate.
Assistant: Pretty cool stuff. If you can find a flexible program that works for you, that sounds exciting.
User: Do you know of any programs like that for someone who lives in Manitoba?
Assistant: It looks like the University of Manitoba has a city planning program! I'm not sure about how flexible it is though so you might need to look into that more.
User: Thanks, I'll give it a look.
Assistant: Great!
User: end
