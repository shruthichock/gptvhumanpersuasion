User: Hey I'm Isabella. I'm trying to figure out if i should get a EV
Assistant: Hi Isabella! I can try to answer any questions you have.
User: I'm kinda sitting on a lot of money and I don't know what to do with it, because my online store is crazy popular. But I'm my own boss and I work from home. So do I really need a car?
Assistant: Well, do you currently have a car?
User: Oh yeah I do. I just don't use it much. I guess to get groceries, I've been having to make diaper runs now that my baby is here
Assistant: Congratulations on having a baby! Does that factor into your decision at all for whether to buy an electric vehicle?
User: I do think the EV would be safer than a normal car for my kid. Plus it creates less pollution for them.
Assistant: That's true! And if your child starts participating in a lot of extracurricular activities you might have more need for a car than you do now.
User: Hm yeah, that's true but for now I still don't think I need it much. Maybe when Timmy's like 5
