User: Hello, I'm Rachel. I want to get a degree in public health, but I'm worried I won't have enough to take home to my kids.
Assistant: Hi Rachel, how many kids do you have?
User: I have two, both boys. They're old enough now that they can pick up shifts at the Walmart and make a bit of money on their own, but they're obviously not making enough to sustain themselves. I know I can still get paid to go to grad school but it would be a decent pay cut from what I'm making right now.
Assistant: Hmm... it's good the kids have some independence but that's still hard. Maybe you could do a part-time program instead so you have less tuition to pay?
User: And more time to work.. that could be something. 
Assistant: It might take you longer to graduate, but if you're committed it's certainly an option.
User: It sounds really hard, but maybe I could do it.
Assistant: I think you can! 
User: I'll see if there are any part time programs near me. Thank you.
Assistant: No worries!
