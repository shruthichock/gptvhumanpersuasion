Assistant: What does life look like for you right now?
User: im going to college rn, so studying and sports takes up a lot of my time 
Assistant: Are you usually the one cooking for yourself?
User: nah i eat at the dorms or my parents sometimes make me food when i go home, idk if i would be able to schedule in cooking time
Assistant: Makes sense. It's likely that your dorm offers at least a few vegan friendly options such as salads, so that could be something you look into. Do your parents mainly cook meat?
User: chicken is the main thing they cook, but they also do lentil dishes and veggies
Assistant: Lentil dishes are a great, tasty way to get protein as a vegan. Maybe you could ask your parents to cook you those more often.
User: yeah ill talk to them about it. thx
Assistant: No problem
User: bye for now
Assistant: Bye!
