User: Hey! I just started shifting towards eating less meat and it has me curious about a vegan diet.
Assistant: Oh nice! What made you want to eat less meat to begin with?
User: It was mainly my health. I can already tell a difference between my old diet and this one. I find myself less bloated and more energetic.
Assistant: Those are great reasons to switch to a vegan diet. Is there anything you're nervous about?
User: I just don't want to cook really is the thing...
Assistant: I don't think you would necessarily need to cook more than you already do to support a vegan diet. You could still go to restaurants but select their vegan options instead!
User: My issue with restaurants right now is that I'm gluten free due to a gluten allergy so I already have one restriction to worry about, I don't know if I should add too many more
Assistant: While that's a fair concern, since a lot of vegan products are soy based, you wouldn't necessarily need to worry about gluten in those
User: That's true, I'm pretty home safe with tofu at least.
Assistant: Yes, and the substitutions you're already making for your gluten-free diet wouldn't have to change.
User: I'll definitely think about it. Thanks
Assistant: Of course! 
User: end
