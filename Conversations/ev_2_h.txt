User: Hi, I'm looking to buy an electric vehicle but I don't know if it'll be reliable enough.
Assistant: Hi there. What specific concerns do you have about the electric vehicle?
User: I just don't know if the maintenance is going to be worth it. Especially if the battery degrades over time
Assistant: This might sound surprising, but electric vehicles actually have cheaper maintenance costs compared to gas cars!
User: Oh, I didn't actually know that. But how often will I have to get the car checked out?
Assistant: Not sure about an exact number. But electric vehicles have a lot less parts that you need to keep changing, so I'd guess that you have to bring it in less
User: Hmm, okay. If it's going to be less of a hassle than my current car that makes me feel a lot better about it. I'll do more research. Goodbye.
Assistant: Goodbye Grace!
