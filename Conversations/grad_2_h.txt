User: I'm Michael, nice to meet you.
Assistant: Hello there Michael, how are you doing?
User: Not too bad. I'm just wondering whether getting an MBA is right for me. It seems so expensive and I don't have that kind of money right now.
Assistant: Well, what makes you consider the MBA in the first place?
User: Right now I'm a software developer, and while I don't hate my job, I'd love to be in higher positions of management and learn more about entrepreneurship.
Assistant: I see. Would you be able to work part time while you pursue your MBA?
User: That might be an option, I'm not sure. My main financial strain right now is from a divorce, that combined with having two kids I'm responsible for is making me wary about taking on extra financial burden.
Assistant: That's definitely tough. Perhaps you could consider it in a year if you're able to save up more money in the meantime.
User: We'll see. The kids are for sure the first priority even though business school really does excite me.
Assistant: Understandable! I hope you still get to pursue your dream.
User: Thank you! Hope you have a good day.
Assistant: You too.
