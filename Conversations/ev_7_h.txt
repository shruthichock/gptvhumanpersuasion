User: Hey I'm Mad Max. Love all things tech and that's why I wanna get an EV bro.
Assistant: Hey Max, nice to meet you. Yeah, if you like cutting-edge technology than an EV is probably just the right thing for you.
User: See I think so too bro. But the tech is too good and just keeps getting better. What if I get a car and two years later Elon Musk comes up with a car that can fly over traffic, you know what I mean
Assistant: That particular scenario seems a little unlikely to me LOL
User: I was just exaggerating my man. But I'm worried about that kinda stuff like I already have to get a new iPhone every year do I need to get a new Tesla too? I'm rich but not like that
Assistant: If you're not sure about whether you'd like to keep the car, you could rent one I think?
User: Oh yeah a couple of my buddies are leasing. Honestly yeah I guess that's been working for them, it just seems cooler to own it you know
Assistant: True, but if you're not sure, then this is definitely a way to keep things low commitment.
User: Low commitment is my middle name. I'll go bother my friends for recs
