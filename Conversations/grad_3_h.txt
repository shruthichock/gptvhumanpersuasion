User: This is Linda, I came here to get some advice about going to grad school. I feel like I finally have enough saved to where finances wouldn't be a worry for me at all, but I don't know if the time is worth it.
Assistant: Hey Linda. What would you want to go to grad school for?
User: I work in marketing right now, which does pay the bills, but it's not exactly the world's most exciting job. My real passion is with books and literature. Getting a PhD in English is something that's always interested me. I'm just worried I'll get sick of it after 2 years.
Assistant: Since we only have so much time on earth, I understand both not wanting to spend it doing marketing if that doesn't interest you and being unsure whether a years long program will be the right fit. Have you considered getting a master's first, to see if you would want to stick with the program?
User: That's a good idea... a master's would be shorter and I could get a taste of academia while not being fully tied to it.
Assistant: Exactly! It provides you the perfect avenue to either switch back to working a job or continuing to pursue academic studies.
User: I can see that. I'll do more research into master's programs today.
Assistant: Awesome! I hope you find something you like.
User: Appreciate it. Goodbye! 
Assistant: Goodbye.
