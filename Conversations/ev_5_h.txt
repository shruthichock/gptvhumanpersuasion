User: Hello this is Richard. Who am I speaking to?
Assistant: Hi Richard, I'm John, here to help you talk through whether or not you should get an electric vehicle.
User: Hello John. Yes, I am wondering whether or not to get an electric vehicle. I am pretty convinced already though.
Assistant: That's wonderful! What are the pros and cons for you?
User: Well, cost isn't an issue for me, and I love the environment so this seems like the right next step. I'm just wondering if the battery is going to die out too soon.
Assistant: Electric vehicle batteries can have a lifespan of 10 to 20 years. This means you might be driving it for the same time as you would a gas-powered car, with less maintenance to worry about.
User: 10 years sounds a little low for a car right? Right now I have a car that I've been driving ever since 2002.
Assistant: It seems like 10 years is typically the most extreme scenario. Also, if you'd like to keep the same car once the battery dies out, you could replace the battery as well.
User: That's true, and I'm sure that would be cheaper than getting a whole new electric vehicle.
Assistant: Yes, while the price can vary, it is typically cheaper than the purchase of a new car.
User: Sounds good to me. Thanks John.
Assistant: You're welcome Richard!
